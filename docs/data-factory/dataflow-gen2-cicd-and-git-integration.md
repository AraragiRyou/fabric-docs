# Dataflow Gen2 with CICD and Git integration support

Dataflow Gen2 now supports CICD and Git integration. This feature allows you to create, edit, and manage dataflows in a Git repository. You can then use Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of dataflows to your data factory.
