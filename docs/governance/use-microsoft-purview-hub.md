# The Microsoft Purview hub for administrators (preview)

Microsoft Purview hub for administrators is a centralized place in Fabric that helps Fabric administrators manage and govern their organization's Fabric data estate. It contains reports that provide insights about sensitive data, item endorsement, and domains, and also serves as a gateway to more advanced capabilities in the Microsoft Purview portal such as Data Catalog, Information Protection, Data Loss Prevention, and Audit.

# [Overview](#tab/overview)

TBD

# [Sensitivity labels](#tab/sensitivity-labels)

* Improve label coverage: Set the label coverage goal to flag where label coverage isn't met. Filter by Domains, Workspaces, Item types, or Creators. Select what you wish to explore and, in the table, below you can monitor related items. Use the button to filter on unlabeled items only.

* Monitor your classified data: Use the label filter to select the sensitivity label you wish to explore, then filter by Domains, Workspaces, Item types, or Creator to find all your classified data.

# [Endorsement](#tab/endorsement)

* Promote items with high visibility: Find items candidates for promotion base on view access. Set view access threshold to flag items with high visibility and no endorsement.

* Monitor your endorsed items: Filter the items by endorsement: Promoted, Certified, and Master Data

# [Domains](#tab/domains)

Find workspaces that aren't associated to any domain with the hierarchy tree below: Select a Domain\ Subdomain\ Workspace to drill through with the items explorer page.

# [Items explorer](#tab/items-explorer)

Use the items explorer's filters to find exactly what items you're looking for in your tenant. You can find what items are located in personal workspaces, which items were created by guest users and much more.

## Considerations and limitations

* The full Purview hub report and its associated dataset are generated in the admin monitoring workspace the first time any admin opens the Purview hub.
* The first time the report and dataset are generated, it might take some time for them to appear.
* Fabric admins can create new reports based on the dataset, but they can't edit the report or dataset directly.
