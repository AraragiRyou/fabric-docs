# The Microsoft Purview hub - admin view (preview)

Microsoft Purview hub is a centralized page in Fabric that helps Fabric administrators and users manage and govern their Fabric data estate. It contains reports that provide insights about sensitive data, item endorsement, and domains, and also serves as a gateway to more advanced capabilities in the Microsoft Purview governance and compliance portals such as Data Catalog, Information Protection, Data Loss Prevention, and Audit.

The Purview hub has a view for Fabric administrators and a view for Fabric data owners. This document describes the Fabric administrators' view.

The administrator's view provides administrators insights about their organization's entire Fabric data estate, and links to capabilities in the Microsoft Purview portal to help them further analyze and manage governance of their organization's Fabric data.

## Considerations and limitations

* The full Purview hub report and its associated dataset are generated in the admin monitoring workspace the first time any admin opens the Purview hub.
* The first time the report and dataset are generated, it may take some time for them to to appear.
* Fabric admins can create new reports based on the dataset, but they can't edit the report or dataset directly.
