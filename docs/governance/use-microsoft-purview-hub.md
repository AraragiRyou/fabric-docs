# The Microsoft Purview hub in Microsoft Fabric (preview)

Microsoft Purview hub is a centralized page in Fabric that helps Fabric administrators and users manage and govern their Fabric data estate. It contains reports that provide insights about sensitive data, item endorsement, and domains, and also serves as a gateway to more advanced capabilities in the Microsoft Purview governance and compliance portals such as Data Catalog, Information Protection, Data Loss Prevention, and Audit.

> [!NOTE]
> In this document, *Fabric administrators* refers to users who have the [Fabric administrator role](../admin/roles.md) or higher.

The Purview hub has a view for Fabric administrators and a view for other (non-admin) Fabric users.

* Fabric administrators see insights concerning their organization's entire Fabric data estate. They also see links to capabilities in the Microsoft Purview governance and compliance portals to help them further analyze and manage governance of their organization's Fabric data.

* Other users see insights about their own Fabric content and links to capabilities in the Microsoft Purview governance portal that help them further explore their data.

When you open the hub, the appropriate view opens. In the sections below, select the appropriate tab to see the information that is relevant to you. The following image shows the view for Fabric administrators.
