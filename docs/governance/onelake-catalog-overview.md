# The OneLake catalog

The OneLake catalog is a central place where data engineers, data scientists, analysts, and decision makers can find, explore, manage, and govern their organization's Fabric content, all within a single contextual interface that doesn't require the user to navigate to a different experience. It supports all Fabric item types, from data items such as lakehouses and semantic models, to insight items such as reports and dashboards, to the various configuration, solution, and process item types.

The catalog's filtering and search capabilities help users easily find the content they need. Other key functionalities include detailed item metadata viewing, cross-workspace item lineage, and real-time activity monitoring.

By integrating experiences and providing detailed views of data subitems, the OneLake catalog enhances data discovery and management, making it more efficient and intuitive. Users can perform ad-hoc data explorations, gain insights, and make data-driven decisions directly within the catalog.

Everything in the OneLake catalog is contextual. You can view and manage any item from within the catalog itself, without needing to navigate out to different experiences, or open an item’s editor.

## How to use the catalog

First scope the catalog to a specific domain and subdomain, for example, Finance -> EMEA. Then use additional filtering and searching capabilities to drill down to the right content. You can filter the items in the catalog by category; Data (e.g., lakehouses, warehouses), Insights (e.g., reports, dashboards), Processes (e.g., pipelines, notebooks), Solutions (e.g., Health), and Configurations (e.g., Environment). In addition, you can filter by tags, endorsement, specific workspace, and more, to find exactly what you need—quickly and efficiently.

Everything in the OneLake catalog is contextual. You can view and manage any item from within the catalog itself, without needing to navigate out to different experiences, or open an item’s editor. This simplifies the navigation and management of your data ecosystem, making your work in Fabric more efficient.

## Exploration

Once you've found the right data, you can perform ad-hoc data explorations on your items from within the OneLake catalog, helping you to gain fresh insights, and take data driven business decisions.

Click on any item in the OneLake catalog and you’ll see relevant information upfront to help you understand it better.
