# Fabric region availability

This article lists the region availability of the Microsoft Fabric [F SKUs](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity), which are available in the [Azure public cloud regions](/e&#x274C;plore/global-infrastructure/geographies). Some of the Fabric workloads might not be immediately available in new regions, or regions where data centers become constrained.

For details about purchasing a Fabric subscription, see [Buy a Microsoft Fabric subscription](../enterprise/buy-subscription.md).

## Home region

Your [home region](find-fabric-home-region.md) is associated with your tenant. If your home region doesn't reside in the regions listed below, you wonâ€™t be able to access all the Fabric functionalities. In such cases, to access all the Fabric features, you can create a capacity in a region where Fabric is available. For more information, see [Multi-Geo support for Fabric](service-admin-premium-multi-geo.md).
