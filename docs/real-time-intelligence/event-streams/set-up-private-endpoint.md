# Connect to Azure streaming sources using private endpoints (Preview)

Managed Private Endpoint is a network security feature provided by the Fabric platform that allows Fabric items to securely access data sources behind a firewall or not accessible from the public internet. By integrating Eventstream with the Managed Private Endpoint, you can now securely connect Eventstream to your Azure services within a private network and ensures your data is securely transmitted over a private network.

The following diagram shows a sample architecture for connecting Eventstream to Azure event hub within a virtual network:

## Supported regions and data sources

* **Eventstream Private Network regions**: The Eventstream private network feature is supported only in selected Fabric tenant regions. These regions include:
   - Australia Southeast
   - East US 
   - Canada Central
   - East US 2
   - North Central US
   - North Europe
   - West Europe
   - West US
   - Central US
* **Supported data sources**: In alignment with Fabric's Managed Private Endpoints, Eventstream only supports private connections for the following streaming sources:
    - **Azure Event Hubs**
    - **Azure IoT Hub**

## Connect to Azure Event Hubs using a private endpoint

Setting up a private connection in Eventstream is straightforward. Follow these steps to create a managed private endpoint for an Azure event hub and stream data to Eventstream over private network.  

### Prerequisites

* Access to the Fabric **premium workspace** with **Contributor** or higher permissions.
* An Azure event hub with public access disabled, and its **Resource ID** ready for creating a private endpoint.
* A Fabric tenant that supports the Eventstream private network feature.

### Step 1: Create an eventstream

* Switch your Power BI experience to **Real-time Intelligence**.
* Navigate to the **Eventstream** section and select **Create**. Name your Eventstream such as â€œeventstream-1."

### Step 2: Create a private endpoint

* In the Fabric workspace, go to the **Workspace settings** and navigate to the **Network security** section.
* Select **Create** to add a new private endpoint.
* Enter the resource ID of your Azure Event Hubs.

### Step 3: Approve the private endpoint in Azure Event Hubs

* Go to the Azure portal and open your Azure event hub.
* In the **Networking** section, navigate to the **Private endpoint connections** tab.
* Locate the private endpoint request from your Fabric workspace and approve it.
* Once approved, the managed private endpoint status updates to **Approved**.

### Step 4: Add an Azure Event Hubs source to Eventstream

* Go back to the eventstream you created in Fabric.
* Select **Azure Event Hubs** and add it as a source in your Eventstream.
* If your event hub is not publicly accessible, uncheck the **Test connection** option.

Once added, Eventstream starts pulling data from your Azure event hub over the private network.

By following these steps, you have a fully operational Eventstream running over a secure private network, using the managed private endpoint to ensure secure data streaming.
