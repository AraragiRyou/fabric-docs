# Eventstream CI/CD - Git Integration and Deployment Pipeline
This article explains how Git integration and deployment pipelines work for Eventstream in Fabric. Learn how to sync a workspace to your Git repository, manage your Eventstream items, and deploy them across different workspaces.

Fabric platform offers Git integration and Deployment pipelines for different scenarios:
    * Use Git integration to sync a workspace to a git repo, and manage incremental change, team collaboration, commit history in Eventstream items.
    * Use deployment pipelines to deploy a workspace (with Eventstream items) to different development, test and production environments.

## Prerequisites

To access the CI/CD features for Eventstream, you need one of the following:

    * A Fabric capacity to use all supported Fabric items. If you don't have one yet, sign up for a free trial.
    * Git integration must be enabled from the Admin portal: [Users can synchronize workspace items with their Git repositories](admin/git-integration-admin-settings.md).
    * Access to an existing repository from **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub**.
    * You're an admin of a Fabric workspace.

## Connect a workspace to a Git repo

Go to the Workspace settings, select Git integration, and choose a git repository to connect with.
