# Eventhouse workspace monitoring

[Workspace monitoring](../get-started/workspace-monitoring-overview.md) is a Microsoft Fabric Eventhouse database that collects and organizes logs and metrics from a range of Fabric items in your workspace. Workspace monitoring lets workspace users access and analyze logs and metrics related to Fabric items in the workspace. You can query the database to gain insights into the usage and performance of your workspace.

## Eventhouse operations

When monitoring your workspace, you can query the following eventhouse operations:

* [Command operations](command-operations.md)

* [Data operation](data-operations.md)

* [Ingestion operations](ingestion-operations.md)

* [Metric operations](metric-operations.md)

* [Query operations](query-operations.md)

## Additional operations

To see a list of all the operations you can query, see [Operation logs](../get-started/workspace-monitoring-overview.md#operation-logs)

## Sample queries

You can find sample queries in the [fabric-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples) GitHub repository.
