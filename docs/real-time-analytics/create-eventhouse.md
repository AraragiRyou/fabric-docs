# Create and manage an event house (preview)

An event house allows you to manage multiple databases at once, sharing capacity and resources to optimize performance and cost. It provides unified monitoring and management across all databases and per database. For more information, see [Eventhouse overview (preview)](eventhouse.md).

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

In this article, you learn how to create an event house, add new databases to an event house, and delete an event house.

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)

## Enable tenant settings in the admin portal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step must be completed by the tenant admin.

1. Browse to the [admin portal](../admin/admin-center.md).

1. In the **Tenant settings** tab, search for *Eventhouse*. For more information, see [About tenant settings](../admin/about-tenant-settings.md).
1. Toggle the button for **Create Eventhouse (preview)** to **Enabled**. For more information, see [Tenant settings - Microsoft Fabric](../admin/tenant-settings-index.md).
1. Select **Apply**.

## Create an event house

1. Browse to your workspace homepage in Real-Time Analytics.

1. Select **New** > **Eventhouse**.

1. Enter a name for the event house. Both an event house and its default child KQL database are created with the same name. The database name, like all items in Fabric, can be renamed at any time.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The event house name can contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, and hyphens. Special characters aren't supported.

1. The [database details](create-database.md#database-details) page opens for the default database in the newly created event house. To view all the databases in this event house or create new databases, select the **Eventhouse** menu item.

## Delete an event house

When you delete an event house, both the event house and all its child KQL databases are deleted forever.

1. Browse to the event house item in your workspace.
1. Select **More menu** [**...**] > **Delete**.
